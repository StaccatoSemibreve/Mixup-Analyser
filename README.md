# Mixup Analyser

UNFINISHED

Uses Nash equilibriums to analyse how mixups will go, probabilistically, if both players play unexploitably. Note: unexploitable play is just the lower bound for doing well in a mixup, so strive to do better than this tool says you will!

Tell this program where to look for input data, and what gamestate to start with, by modifying `run.yaml`. Input data is in the form of YAML files structured like the example `Simple.yaml`, which contains examples of every possible part of the format. Will make a specification when the actual program itself is in a usable state!
